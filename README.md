---

## 🔗 MCP Integration

**This is what makes LyShell different.** It serves as an MCP server, letting external AI clients like Claude Code control terminals via the MCP protocol — listing sessions, sending commands, reading output, transferring files, and managing connections.

> 📖 **Configuration** — see [MCP Configuration](docs/mcp-config.md). In most cases you don't configure anything by hand: launch an agent from the **Agent Launcher** and ask it to configure LyShell as its MCP server itself. Registration configs are emitted in **JSON / CLI / TOML** to fit different clients.

### Tools

### Security

- 🔑 **Per-session authorization** — each terminal gets its own scoped permission
- 🚪 **Capability gates** — enforced server-side on every endpoint
- 🛡️ **Destructive-command check** — scans for `rm -rf`, `dd if=`, fork bombs
- 🔒 **Shared PTY locking** — MCP vs human input never collide
- 📊 **Audit panel** — calendar + filter + pagination, accessible from the title bar

> ⚠️ Full-screen TUI apps (vim, htop, less) are not supported over MCP — ANSI stripping garbles alternate-screen sequences. Use the LyShell UI native terminal instead.

## 🤖 AI Agents

Agent-agnostic terminal — no lock-in to any AI tool. Launch any CLI agent and it runs in a regular terminal with full scrollback, split panes, and IME support.

| Agent | Command |
|-------|---------|
| 🧠 Claude Code | `claude` |
| 🛠️ OpenAI Codex | `codex` |
| 🤝 Aider | `aider` |
| 🐙 Copilot CLI | `gh copilot` |

**First-class Harness agents** — `dsh`, `codex`, and `claude` are first-class in the Harness panel: each gets its own left-rail tab, a dedicated workspace list, dependency detection, and per-workspace model & environment variables (model passed as `--model`, with `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` defaults). Claude workspaces add an optional **skip-permissions** switch (launches with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`), and any workspace can opt into **worktree isolation** — see [DeepSeek Harness](#-deepseek-harness).

**Custom agents**: Any CLI tool can be registered — name, command, icon, working directory, env vars. Sessions are transient: close the tab, it's gone.

## 🐋 DeepSeek Harness

A first-class home for **DeepSeek Harness** workspaces. Manage every workspace in one dedicated panel, then launch each one as a terminal TUI **or** an embedded Web UI — inside LyShell, not a separate browser window. The two can even run **side by side in split panes**.

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗂️ **Workspace panel** — create, edit, delete | 🔧 **Variable sets** — pre-configure env sets, switch the enabled one |
| 🎛️ **Model presets** — save & switch models per workspace | 🖥️ **TUI launch** — `dsh-tui` in a native terminal tab |
| 🌳 **Worktree isolation** — dedicated git worktree per workspace | 🏷️ **Brand badge** — session tabs show which harness launched them |

### Dependency detection & install

CLI dependencies — `dsh` + `dsh-tui` for DeepSeek Harness, `codex` / `claude` for the others — are detected by scanning PATH **once at app startup** (all three agents in parallel) and cached: opening a Harness tab reads the cached result instantly, no repeated scans. When something is missing, the panel shows which dependency is absent, its one-line install command, and the source-repo link — it never installs anything for you. A **Re-detect** button forces a fresh scan, and PATH is read live from the registry, so a freshly installed CLI is picked up without restarting LyShell.

### Environment tab: pre-configure, then switch

The panel splits into **Workspaces** and **Environment** tabs. In the **Environment** tab, pre-configure named **variable sets** — collections of `KEY=VALUE` (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `DSH_HOME`, …). At most one set is **enabled** at a time; click a set to switch to it, or click the always-on **System environment** slot to fall back to LyShell's own process environment.

Each workspace can bind to a specific set, or **follow the enabled set** — pick nothing and it inherits whichever set is currently enabled (or the system environment when none is). Enter secrets once, then switch between environments without touching each workspace.

Secret-looking values (`*_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, …) are **masked as dots** in the profile editor — click the eye toggle to reveal one. For **codex** workspaces, the set's `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is additionally written into `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (`[model_providers.*].base_url`) right before launch — the Rust codex CLI ignores the env var. That edit is line-surgical (comments, formatting and other providers preserved verbatim), idempotent, atomic, and the original file is backed up once as `.bak`.

### Worktree isolation

Point multiple agents at the same repository without them stomping each other. Flip a workspace to **worktree** isolation and it launches inside a dedicated git worktree at `<repo>/.lyshell-worktrees/<key>` on branch `lyshell/<key>` — created on first launch, reused ever after, so **uncommitted changes survive restarts**. Deleting the workspace never deletes its worktree.

- **Private (default)** — a readable key is auto-generated (`claude-myapp-x7k2`); each workspace gets its own checkout.
- **Shared** — set the key explicitly, and every workspace that fills in the same key shares one checkout *and* one branch, even across dsh / codex / claude — they see each other's edits live.
- The form **previews the exact worktree path** before you save; invalid keys (path separators, ref-hostile characters) are rejected up front.

### Launch: TUI or Web UI

Every workspace opens two ways:

- **Terminal TUI** — `dsh-tui` runs as a standard terminal tab with full scrollback, split panes, and IME support.
- **Embedded Web UI** — spawned as `dsh web --port 0`; LyShell parses the real port from stdout and renders the app in an in-app `<webview>` tab. No browser, no manual port juggling.

### TUI + Web UI, side by side

Drag the Web UI tab to a pane edge to split it into its own pane — the TUI and the embedded Web UI run **in the same frame, side by side**. Drag it back onto a pane's center to remount it as a regular tab.

### Web UI acts like a terminal tab

- **✕ close** — only ✕ tears the tab down and terminates the subprocess.
- **Switch away** — switching to another tab hides the Web UI but keeps the page state and the `dsh web` subprocess alive; switching back resumes instantly.

### Security

- 🔒 **Loopback-locked** — navigation and popups are pinned to the workspace's loopback origin.
- ✅ **Validated URL** — the echoed URL is checked (loopback + explicit port, no embedded credentials) *before* the `<webview>` ever loads it.

## 🌐 Web Tabs

The left-rail **Web** panel gives LyShell a light built-in browser for dashboards and docs. Type a URL (no scheme → `https://` is prepended), press Enter, and it opens as a regular tab in the active split pane — same drag-to-split and tab semantics as the embedded `dsh web` UI, so a dashboard can sit right next to the terminal that feeds it.

- **Open-tabs list** — click to jump to the hosting pane and activate the tab, ✕ to close.
- **Recent history** — successfully loaded URLs are remembered (30 most recent, deduplicated, persisted locally) and offered as native autocomplete in the input; click to reopen, ✕ to delete a single entry, or clear all.
- **Safety** — only `http`/`https` URLs pass validation; webview navigation and popups route through a dedicated partition in the main process.

## 🧩 Plugin System & Python Scripting

### Plugins

Permission-gated host for **Python** (one-shot / persistent) and **Node.js** (persistent) plugins. Install from local directory, ZIP, or remote URL. Each plugin runs with its own scoped authorization — granular permissions (read / write / execute / file / session control) with path safety, destructive-command confirmation, and shared-PTY locking.

> ⚠️ Plugins activate on startup (`onStartup`) today. Event-based activation and declarative UI contributions are not wired up yet.

📦 Ready-to-run examples in [`examples/`](examples/).

### Python Engine

Embedded Python with `LyShell` API for terminal automation:

```python
session = LyShell.get_current_session()
LyShell.execute("ls -la")
LyShell.send("hello\n")
LyShell.wait_for("prompt$")
```

Environment variables: `LYSHELL_SESSION_ID` · `LYSHELL_SESSION_TYPE` · `LYSHELL_HOST` · `LYSHELL_PORT`.

Python path auto-detected from system PATH, configurable in settings.

> 💡 For long-running or scheduled tasks, consider **Node.js plugins** via the [Plugin System](#-plugin-system--python-scripting) — they're a better fit.
